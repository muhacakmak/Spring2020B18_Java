Data Structurs: in order to managae the data effeciently and in an organized manner

        -- Array (fixed)
        -- Collection (Dynamic)
        -- Map
Array: size is fixed
       supports primitives and objects
       Can be multi-dimensional
       has index, accept duplicates
       Arrays.sort(arrayName);
       Collections.sort()
collections framework:  consists of multiple interfaces, each interfaces has multiple implemntations
            all the clasess and interfaces are presented in "java.util"
Iterable(I): root interface. super-type of all interfaces in collections framework.
Collection (I):    extended by by List(I), Set(I), Queue(I)

            List(I): implemented by ArrayList(C), LinkedList(C), Vector(C)
                    has Index Numbers, accepts duplicates, size is dynamic
                ArrayList(C): array based class. internally uses array, singly linked
                        singly linked ==> retriving data is faster ( get() )
                LinkedList(C): each objects are doublly linked
                        doubly linked ==> removing & adding are faster ( remove(), add() )
                Vector(C): array based class, is synchronized. only prefered in muti-thread
                        extended by Stack(C): array based class, is synchonized, Last In First Out order
                                pop(): LIFO, returns the last object from the stack and removes it from stack
            Queue(I): does not have index numbers, size is dynamic, accepts duplicates, First in first out order
                    Poll(): removes the first object in the queue.
            Set(I): does not accept duplicates. does not have index number, size is dynamic
                    hashset vs linkedhasset:
                                    linkedhashset keeps the insertion order as it is
                                    hashset is faster than linkedhasset
                    set is extended by SortedSet(I): sorted set is implemented by TreeSet
                            TreeSet(C): does not accept duplicates, and sort the objects
                        hashset vs TreeSet:
                                hashset accepts null, TreeSet does not accept null
                                hashset is faster than TreeSet
null: default value of all reference-type (all non-primitives).
        does not refer to any objects
        it's not instance of anything

        WebElement elemnt;  ==> null
        String str;  ===> null
// List<WebElement> list = driver.findElements(By.xpath(""));
synchronized: used for achiving thread-safety
        advantage: thread safe
        disadvantage: slower
thread-safety: one thread at a time in multi-thread environment
thread: process of operating system scheduling object
multi-thread: two or more thread are being executed
Tasks:
 1. write a program that can remove the duplicated characters from String
 2. write a program that can identify if two strings are build out of the same letters
        ex:
            str1 = "abababa"
            str2 ="ab";
            output: true
