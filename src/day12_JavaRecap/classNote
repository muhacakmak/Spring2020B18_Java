rnoon' reveiw:
                scanner
                ternary
                switch
package name: day12_JavaRecap
Scanner methods:
            next(): returns String (only takes the first word)
            nextLine(): TAKES EVERYTHING THE SCANNER HAS, EVEN THE "ENTER" KEY
            close(): closes the scanner
when do we use nextLine method:
                        first step:  next();
                                                    nextLIne() to takeout the enter from the previous metod of scanner
                        next step: nextLine();
declare the scanner:
            Scanner  variableName = new Scanner(System.in);
                we call the methods of the scanner through the variableName
next week:
        String manipulation
