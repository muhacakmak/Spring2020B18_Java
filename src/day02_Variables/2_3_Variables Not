Primitive datatyepes:
                byte,
                  We can assig whole numbers
                  the number is must be between to -128<=byte<=127
                short ,
                  We can assig only whole number
                  Must be with in -32768<=short <=32767 
                int ,

                	int num= 1_000_000_00 it is easy to read ... 
                long,
                We can only assign whol  number  
                byte<short < int <long <
                small one canbe assigned to larger one 

                float,

                We can assign decimals number 
                 when we assign only decimal number as a float need to add f.F end of the number.

                 double (used more often  ): we can assign decimals.
