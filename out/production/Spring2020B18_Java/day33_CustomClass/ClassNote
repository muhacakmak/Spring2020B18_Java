1. write 1. write a program that can return the unique objects
 from a anArray List of Integers
				list: {1,1,2,3,4,5,5}
				sout(list); ==> {2,3,4};
		Note: 1. DO NOT use any extra arrayList
			  2. DO NOT use any loops
			  3. do not use any sort method
			  4. use predicate only and collections methods only
		Hint:   Collections.frequency() // will return the frequency
				removeIf( frequency == 1)  can keep the unique objects in arrayList
2. write a program that can return the duplicated objects from a an ArrayList of Integers
			Ex:
				list: {1,1,2,3,4,5,5}
				sout(list); ==> {1,1,5,5};
		Note: 1. DO NOT use any extra arrayList
			  2. DO NOT use any loops
			  3. DO NOT use any sort method
			  4. Use predicate and collections methods only
		Hint:   Collections.frequency() // will return the frequency
				removeIf( frequency > 1)  can keep the duplicated objects in arrayList

				3. task:
                			1. create an ArrayList of string called country names
                			2. write a program that can remove all the country names that have length of 10 or greater
                4. write a program that can extract the sepecial characters, digits and alphebets from a string and stores them into seperate ArrayLists of Character:
                			ex:
                				str = "ABCD123$%#@&456EFG!";
                				list1: {$, %, #, @, &, !}
                				list2: {A, B, C, D, E, F, G}
                				list3: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
