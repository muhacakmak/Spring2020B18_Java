package name: Practice_05_20_2020
access modifiers:

        private < default < protected < public
Inheritance: builds relations between classes (easiest way to get rich)

            sub (child) & super (parent) classes
            Class A  extends class B
                 sub         sper class
            Class C extends class B
            sub class: inherits from super class
                    only the VISIBLE variables & methods can be inherited
                    private: NEVER
                    default: can be inherited to sub classes that are in same package
                    protected & public : can ALWAYS be inherited to ANY sub class
            super class: cannot inherit anything from sub class
            a class can be extedned by multiple classes
            a class can ONLY extend one class
                class A{ // a
                    int a;
                }
                class B extends A{ // a, b
                    int b;
                }
                class C extends B{ // a, b, c
                    int c;
                }
