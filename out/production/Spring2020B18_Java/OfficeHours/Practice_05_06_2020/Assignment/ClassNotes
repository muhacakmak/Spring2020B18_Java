package Name: day34_CustomClass

warmup:
1. create a custom class for the carpet class that should contain the following:

                instance variables:
                        width, length, unitPrice, isPersian (boolean)

                instance methods:
                        customOrder(): sets the carpet' width, length, unitprice, & isParsian
                        calcCost(): should be able to caculate the total cost of the carpet and return it as double
                        toString(): should be able to display all the info of the carpet including the total cost of the carpet as calculated by calcCost()

            total price of carpet= (width*length)*unitprice
            if the carpet is persian  carpet that's came from Turkey, add 200$ to the totalPrice

            create a class called carpetObjects, and create an array of the carpet that contains 5 carpet objects ( make sure you set the instance variables of those objets)

            create two ArrayList of carpets:
                                        persianCarpets
                                        reugularCarpets
            write a program to store all the persian Carpets into the list of persianCarpets, and store all regular carpets into the list of reugularCarpets

                    use for each loop to print out all the persian carpets

this: refers to the object instance
		this.: we can call any object instances
class : not concrete

object: is concrete

task:
create a class called Testers
			Attributes:
				name, employeeID, JobTitle, Salary
			Actions:
				setTesterInfo(), smokeTesting(),  creatingTicket();
create a class called Developers
			Attributes:
				name, employeeId, JobTitle, Salary
			Actions:
				setDeveloperInfo(), coding(), fixingBugs()
create a class called ScrumTeam
			Attributes:
				name
				List of Testers,
				List of Developers,
			Actions:
				hireTester
				fireTester
				hireDeveloper
				fireDeveloper
				DailyStandUp
crteate a class called BankofAmerica:
				Bank of America in VA is p-lanning to create a scrum teams:
						4 developers 2 testers
				 create a arraylist of scrum team and:
						 1. use the for loop to print out every single employees from BOA' scrum teams
						 2. calculate the total budgets of the screumteam
 /*
        create scrum2: 4 developers, 2 testers
        create scrum3: 5 developers, 3 testers
        create an array of scrum: {scrum1, scrum2, scrum3};
            1. iterator the array to print out all the testers who have salary > 120000
            2. print out all the developers who have salary < 120000
        create an ArrayList of scrum: {scrum1, scrum2, scrum3};
               1. remove all the testers who have salary < 100000
               2. remove all the developers who have salary < 120000
           NOTE: DO NOT create any ArrayList of Testers or Developers.
                Use the ArrayLists in ScrumTeam class only
