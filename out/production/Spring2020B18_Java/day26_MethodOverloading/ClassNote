Warmup tasks:
	1. write a return method called frequency that accepts two parameters: string str and char ch,
		the method returns the frequency of the ch from the str as an int
			Ex:
				frequency("AAA", 'A') ==>  3
				frequency("ABAB", 'B') ==> 2
			Note: MUST use Arrays and for each loop
	2. use the above method to create another called uniques that accepts a string paramter and returns it's unique characters as String
			Ex: uniques("ABBC"); 		==> "AC"
				uniques("Cybertek");  	==> "cybrtk"
